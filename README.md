Project - Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock
Creating a game website that mimics the game of rock paper scissors, but there's a twist to it. To achieve this I first created a figma that I felt happy with, then I simply used html and css to make it look as close as I could to the figma. After that I used a TON of js code to make the functionality of the figma work, for example making elements appear and dissapear, and even adding sound.

Peer Review: I honestly like the creativity, I styled mine off of kahoot and you chose to do a Samurai battle. Reading through your code, it definitly has a lot too it, overall very organized. Good job on doing this all on one page. I ran everything without a hitch.
