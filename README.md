Project - Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock
Creating a game website that mimics the game of rock paper scissors, but there's a twist to it. To achieve this I first created a figma that I felt happy with, then I simply used html and css to make it look as close as I could to the figma. After that I used a TON of js code to make the functionality of the figma work, for example making elements appear and dissapear, and even adding sound.
